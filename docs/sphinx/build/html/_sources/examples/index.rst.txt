The following series of examples provide an interactive demonstration of the reversible physics capabilities currently implemented in REMAT. All examples make use of the WebAssembly build of REMAT in combination with pygbag to enable native execution and real-time animation in the web browser. The resulting graphical demos were partially inspired by the interactive `Exact Bitwise Reversible Integrator <https://www.josstam.com/reversible>`_ created by Jos Stam.\ :footcite:`stam_2022`

For all examples:

 * :raw-html:`&larr;` (left arrow key): Advance the interactive simulation *backward* in time.
