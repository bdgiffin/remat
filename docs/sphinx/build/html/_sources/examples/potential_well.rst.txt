Potential Well
==============

This example is similar in nature to the bouncing ball problem, in that it illustrates changes in total system energy over time, and the difficulties associated with reconstructing the initial conditions if the block eventually comes to rest at the bottom of the well. Nonetheless, given a bit-reversible implementation as suggested in this work, it is possible to exactly recover the initial conditions.
