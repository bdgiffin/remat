Contacting Blocks
=================
   
.. raw:: html

This example demonstrates the ability of the proposed bit-reversible integrators to handle (frictionless) contact. In particular, penalty-based formulations of contact entail configurational forces due to contact which are dependent exclusively upon the currently deformed state of the system, rendering them amenable to a reversible implementation. A bit-reversible impelementation for frictional contact remains an open challenge that will be addressed in future work.
