Triple Pendulum
===============

The triple pendulum problem illustrates the behavior of a chaotic system which is highly sensitive to minor perturbations that can lead to drastic alterations of the trajectory of the system as a whole. Even very minor errors due to floating point arithmetic will lead to totally different simulated behaviors, making this problem an excellent benchmark to demonstrate the importance of bit-reversibility. This particular demonstration was inspired by the interactive `Exact Bitwise Reversible Integrator <https://www.josstam.com/reversible>`_ created by Jos Stam.\ :footcite:`stam_2022`
